# AboutAIDS

## Project Introduction
According to the UNICEF, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is still a major public health issue, especially in the youth: Of the estimated 650,000 people who died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2021, 17% of them were children under 20 years of age.

The purpose of this project is to allow, through a tool of data visualisation and inspection, a better understanding of the HIV (in particular its most advanced and dangerous stage, AIDS), its evolution in the world and its impact on the youth in particular.

To do so, we can vizualize the UNICEF HIV/AIDS dataset, which offers different informations about the spread of AIDS in the world's youth specifically.

To use the tool, simply select the indicator you want to visualize, and select the parameters. Then, select how you want to visualize the data.

The dataset is available on the UNICEF website: https://data.unicef.org/topic/hiv-aids/
